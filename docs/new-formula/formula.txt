Remove all the stuff , being able to filter etc.
The table is just Program number, Morning Line Odds, Horses name, TWIZ figure (see below)

No need to loop etc, we only want the last race.

Jockey = average of current year+previous year, Jockey Win%+# of wins + Place%+# of places + Show %+# of shows. (percent as a whole number so .50 is 50)
Trainer = average of current year+previous year, Trainer Win%+# of wins + Place%+# of places + Show %+# of shows.
Horse = average  Horses lifetime win%+# of wins,Place%+number of place+Show%+# of shows.

twiz = TODAY's WEIGHT + Number of runners last race - Finish position last race - Odds last race + (average Jockey+trainer+horse / 10)- Morning Line Odds

This should be the areas to compute the above figure.

Still in the original format broken by race in tables etc.
predictability score of race can stay, but no need for all the rest.

This should be much eesier to program/manage and it is all I use now, and works very very well compared to other things on the market.
