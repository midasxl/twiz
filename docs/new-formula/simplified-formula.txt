tried to simplify what I needed.


Jockey=average of current year+previous year, Jockey Win%+# of wins + Place%+# of places + Show %+# of shows. (percent as a whole number so .50 is 50)
Trainer=average of current year+previous year, Trainer Win%+# of wins + Place%+# of places + Show %+# of shows.
Horse=average  Horses lifetime win%+# of wins,Place%+number of place+Show%+# of shows.


FROM JUST THE LAST RACE

twiz  =( (TODAY's WEIGHT + Number of runners last race - Finish position last race - Odds last race)
+ average (Jockey+trainer+horse) + best of last 3 speed figures, best of early or late pace from last race))/4,  minus - Morning Line Odds.
